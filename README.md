**Analysis**

This repo holds a workflow script to process Illumina sequencing read data with quality trimming and removal of phiX174, *de novo* genome assembly of quality controlled sequence reads and to annotate the genome. 

**Data**

Raw and quality controls reads, assemblies, and annotations are also at Open Science Framework (OSF) repo [link](https://osf.io/7t4j8/)<br />
NCBI GenBank BioProject number is PRJNA550454 [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA550454/)
